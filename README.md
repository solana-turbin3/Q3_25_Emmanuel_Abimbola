# Read Me, not the Docs😂😊😊

This will chronicle my progress during the 8-Week Turbin3. 
I will intentionally let it read like a thriller, so it becomes relatable to anyone.

If code scares you, or it's still your first time, don't worry! I'd make sure you grow to enjoy it.

I have a traditional engineering background (not CS: mechanics yeah). Some years ago, I intentionally learnt JS because I thought computers were the future. I never got to master it: it was just too cumbersome, but I knew enough to find my way around basic stuffs. I also got fascinated with crypto and started reading about it

So fast forward to when I applied and got the invite to attend the orientation; I didn't know I signed up for rigour. Let'sdive into it:

## Prereq
- Prereq was treacherous. I got to learn and adapt rapidly. Spent 6hrs fixing a simple issue. (Skill issue actually 😂)
- finished the ts section 1 minute to the deadline. I was literally on adrenaline for those 2 says
- I spent the weekend poring over solana docs. Didn't make it any easier. I just showed me I had a whole lot to learn.
- Yayy! It was Jeff in the mail. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aa180ab-6088-418f-bf4d-9c1da33c333d)
I made it in guys.

## Week 1
- I participated in both Sol A and B for all 3 days (the knowledge and experience gap was just too much... I needed every ounce of coverup time to fill it)
- Setup my git finally (the right way), thanks to duckDuck and Claude
- Uploaded the repos @solana-starter and @rustprereqs
- 

## Week 2
- The week started on a high note with yours truly going over concepts in Rust, and getting familiar with more advanced topics
- I made some PRs to some projects I encountered.
- Then came the first lesson, where I learnt a different implementation of encapsulating functions from @Shrinath.
- Working on the tasks, and also pushing to git consistently.
- The assignment on the capstone will continue in earnest.
- Thereafter, I worked on making escrows. *In Solana, everything is an escrow, with a nice frontend*. I solidified my knowledge on this at the Saturday session with MacCana, and also by interacting with Berg on the sidelines after a particular class.
- The last class of the week was pretty dense to take in all at once. We talked about AMMs and I was introduced to the concept of economics and how it is codified on-chain to create market makers.
- Outside class hours, I spent additional hours trying to understand the concepts and rewatch the tutorials to gain mastery over them.
- The evidence of my learning is in the gradual sophistication of my commits. Each commit differs from the previous one in awesome ways.
- This is week 2, but it feels like I have been doing this for about 10 days.
- - *Stay tuned for more updates...*
