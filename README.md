# Read Me, not the DocsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

This will chronicle my progress during the 8-Week Turbin3. 
I will intentionally let it read like a thriller, so it becomes relatable to anyone.

If code scares you, or it's still your first time, don't worry! I'd make sure you grow to enjoy it.

I have a traditional engineering background (not CS: mechanics yeah). Some years ago, I intentionally learnt JS because I thought computers were the future. I never got to master it: it was just too cumbersome, but I knew enough to find my way around basic stuffs. I also got fascinated with crypto and started reading about it

So fast forward to when I applied and got the invite to attend the orientation; I didn't know I signed up for rigour. Let'sdive into it:

## Prereq
- Prereq was treacherous. I got to learn and adapt rapidly. Spent 6hrs fixing a simple issue. (Skill issue actually ðŸ˜‚)
- finished the ts section 1 minute to the deadline. I was literally on adrenaline for those 2 says
- I spent the weekend poring over solana docs. Didn't make it any easier. I just showed me I had a whole lot to learn.
- Yayy! It was Jeff in the mail. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aa180ab-6088-418f-bf4d-9c1da33c333d)
I made it in guys.

## Week 1
- I participated in both Sol A and B for all 3 days (the knowledge and experience gap was just too much... I needed every ounce of coverup time to fill it)
- Setup my git finally (the right way), thanks to duckDuck and Claude
- Uploaded the repos @solana-starter and @rustprereqs
- 

## Week 2
- The week started on a high note with yours truly going over concepts in Rust, and getting familiar with more advanced topics
- I made some PRs to some projects I encountered.
- Then came the first lesson, where I learnt a different implementation of encapsulating functions from @Shrinath.
- Working on the tasks, and also pushing to git consistently.
- The assignment on the capstone will continue in earnest.
- Thereafter, I worked on making escrows. *In Solana, everything is an escrow, with a nice frontend*. I solidified my knowledge on this at the Saturday session with MacCana, and also by interacting with Berg on the sidelines after a particular class.
- The last class of the week was pretty dense to take in all at once. We talked about AMMs and I was introduced to the concept of economics and how it is codified on-chain to create market makers.
- Outside class hours, I spent additional hours trying to understand the concepts and rewatch the tutorials to gain mastery over them.
- The evidence of my learning is in the gradual sophistication of my commits. Each commit differs from the previous one in awesome ways.
- This is week 2, but it feels like I have been doing this for about 10 days.
- I submitted my letter of intent a day ahead of the deadline. I am now onto putting it all to work.

## Week 3 
- This would easily be marked as the most stress free, yet mentally challenging week of the program so far for me.
- I began the User_Stories task quite early. This led me on the path to developing FairPlay Protocol. There are many unanswered subsections that I will have to cater to.
- I attended the solA classes this week, and reviewed the solB at later times because of hectic daily schedules.
- Working on the NFT marketplace. More implementation coming soon.
- My main takeaway from the week's classes is to view my project from a User's standpoint. Code is beautiful, but it is worse when no one uses your code.
- I went ahead to create an X account for the project, and started doing some brief branding for it.


## Week 4
- This might rank as the most hectic I have faced so far, I think the coming week will be wilder though.
- It begun with implementing some changes to the codebase I had earlier.
- I then went along to review my codebase to accommodate some changes in the week.
- I prepared some slides that I presented on my capstone project. @bitn8 did some reviews on it, and I niched down to develop a POC.
- <img width="1615" height="880" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-26 120603" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81497ca4-25b2-4d6f-8741-7612a1046a7f" />
- Learnt some alphas with MagicBlock and its use case. @Apaar did a session for Sol A, which I am yet to catch up on, but definitely will.
- The weekend got me rewatching the videos and coming up with better ways to do the tasks.


Wrapping Up
- The final week was all about the enrichment classes. I got to learn from many projects within the ecosystem.
- Fun fact: turbin3 grads are doing the mos twithin the ecosystem.
- I signed up to present my pitch during the demoday. It was quite blissful.
- - *Stay tuned for more updates...*
